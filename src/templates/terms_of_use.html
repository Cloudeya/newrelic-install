                    <h3><strong>Our Services and Your Responsibility</strong></h3>

The App identifies to your to healthcare professionals who have agreed to be listed on our App and have engaged us to perform related services. You will be able to select a mental health professional who you wish will perform mental health services for you including psychotherapy. After your selection, the App then sends a message to the professional you selected that asks the professional whether he or she would like to provide you with the requested services. In the event a health care professional agrees to provide you with healthcare services, the App schedules those services and bills you on behalf of the healthcare professional. We make no representation or warranty to you any mental healthe professional will be available to perform mental health services.</p>

                    <p>We may use individually identifiable health information that you submit as part of the Services to create de-identified information (i.e., information that does not identify you), and we may use or disclose de-identified information without restriction.

                    <h3><strong>Payment</strong></h3>

                    <p>There is no charge to register with us or download the App on your mobile device. You are charged only when you actually use the Services to schedule a consultation with a clinician. Each clinician sets his or own fees for his or her time and services, but your payment to them includes a portion that is retained by us for our administrative Services in connection with the App. We reserve the right to introduce a fee in the future for downloading the App as registering with us. If we decide to introduce such a fee, we will inform you accordingly and allow you to either continue or terminate your account.</p>

                    <p>The rates that apply for the in-person services provided by the clinician can be found on our website and through the App. These may be modified or updated from time to time. It is your own responsibility to remain informed about the current rates for the services made available through the App. MindHug, Ltd. shall, on behalf of the clinician, charge you for the medical services provided to you by that clinician. You agree that you will pay for all services you receive from the clinician, and that MindHug may charge your credit card account, as provided by you when registering for the Services, for the services including any taxes and late fees, as applicable, that may be accrued by or in connection with your account. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing MindHug, Ltd. with a valid credit card account for payment of all fees at all times. Any payment made is non-refundable.</p>

                    <p>We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to link us to your credit card account. The processing of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection with your use of the App will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor and your credit card issuer in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor or your credit card issuer. In connection with your use of the Services (and specifically in connection with your scheduling of a telephonic or in-person consultation with a health care professional), MindHug, Ltd. will obtain certain transaction details, which we will use solely in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p>At present we do not process any insurance claims, nor will the clinicians process claims on your behalf. Although the consultations/treatments you receive from clinicians through the App may or may not be covered by your insurance, it is solely up to you to contact your health plan, determine whether coverage applies and submit a claim. You are responsible for the full fee (and for paying the fee in advance) regardless of whether you later are able to receive reimbursement from your health plan for part or all of the cost.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Modifying or Deleting Your Client Content.</strong></h3>

                    <p>Because certain of your Client Content, including your individually identifiable health information, becomes part of your Clinician's health record about you, you cannot delete it. If you want us to modify or delete your Client Content, please contact your Clinician with your request. We’ll work with your Clinician, and, if appropriate, we’ll take steps to deactivate your Client Account and to modify or delete your information as soon as we can in consultation with your Clinician, but please note that some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law. In addition, your Clinician may still retain copies of this information as part of your medical records. To obtain a copy of your medical records, please contact your Clinician directly.</p>

                    <p>For more information on how your information may be used, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>

                    <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United Kingdom without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></h3>

                    <p><p>You and MindHug, Ltd. agree that any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content will be settled by final and binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the United Kingdom courts located in London, England and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Arbitration Rules</strong></h3>

                    <p>The arbitration will be administered by the The London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “LCIA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. The LCIA Rules are available at https://www.lcia.org/ or by calling the LCIA at +44 (0) 20 7936 6200.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Arbitration Process</strong></h3>

                    <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the LCIA Rules. (The LCIA provides a general Demand for Arbitration and a separate Demand for Arbitration for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the LCIA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the LCIA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the LCIA Rules.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure</strong></h3>

                    <p>Unless you and MindHug, Ltd. otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in London, United Kingdom. If your claim does not exceed £10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and MindHug, Ltd. submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds £10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the LCIA Rules. Subject to the LCIA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Arbitrator’s Decision</strong></h3>

                    <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the LCIA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Fees</strong></h3>

                    <p>The arbitrator’s fees will be shared equally between you and MindHug, Ltd. and each of you and MindHug, Ltd. will bear its own costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>

                    <h3><strong>General Terms</strong></h3>

Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
